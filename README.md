## Overview

The **Interplanetary Rover** offers a customizable platform where students learn hands-on skills across multiple fields like **engineering**, **electronics**, and **coding**. The aim is not just to focus on one specific area, but to give students the tools and exposure to various disciplines. By working through this project, students can:

- Explore how hardware and software interact.
- Build systems from scratch using the available hardware.
- Learn and apply **critical thinking** to solve real-world problems.

## Features

- **Robotic Arm**: Manipulates objects and performs sample collection.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Use of sensors for self-driving.
- **Modular Design**: Customizable for different learning goals.
- **Multi-Disciplinary Learning**: Focus on electronics, programming, and mechanics.

## Educational Purpose

This project is meant to **develop broad skills** across multiple technical fields. Students will need to figure out:

- The tools and parts they need to enhance or modify the rover.
- How to code the rover to perform tasks.
- How electronics and hardware work together in real-world applications.

By learning a bit of everything, from electronics to mechanics, students get an invaluable preview of what different **careers** and **academic fields** entail. This project aims to help students make **informed decisions** about their futures without bias.

## Hardware Requirements

The hardware provided is only the beginning! Students should use their imagination and decide what additional hardware or sensors they may need to accomplish their goals. Some ideas include:

- Extra sensors
- Cameras
- Custom parts for enhanced functionality
- Alternative power sources
